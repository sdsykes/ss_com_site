<br><h2>Ruby BrainF*ck interpreter</h2>

<P>This is an implementation of the <A href="https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/">BrainFuck language</A> in Ruby.<BR></P>
<P>In case you haven't come across Ruby before, it is an extremely well designed object oriented programming language, which has a number of interesting features - to learn more visit the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en">Ruby home page</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer ETA to BrainFuck, but I was wondering if you could translate between the two.  In fact, I think it would be possible to write a BrainFuck to ETA converter without too much trouble, but going the other way would be enormously difficult - the divide instruction would be particularly tricky I think.  
<p>A converter from to ETA would need to represent the array on the stack - meaning that at the start of the program you would need to place 30,000 zeros there, so your program would begin with 60k of <code>ne</code> instructions.  Unless you invented some clever way of extending the stack as required.  Of course, strict ETA interpreters that only have a 100 byte stack don't stand a chance anyway, but let's not worry about that.
<p>I wrote this interpreter as a step to inventing a translation program, and it's here in case anyone needs it for anything, unlikely as that may seem.

<p>***** Updated 16.5.2012
<br>
<p>Alexandre Moutot wrote to me that my program did not work. And so it didn't - it was totally broken. So it only took 11 years for someone to notice. Anyway, I've fixed it now - this version should work ok.
<br>
<br>
<p>***** Updated 26.10.2013
<br>
<p>Alexandre Moutot again - this time providing a patch that allows you to print the character '\0', which was confused with EOF. Also adding some restrictions to enforce char sized values after increment or decrement. Thanks!
