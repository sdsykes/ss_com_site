    Note: The info file should be named as pic.bmp
    ----

    Remember the days when computer art was pictures made from ascii
    characters?  Go back in time with this ascii art generator!

    The generator generates ascii pictures from 24 bit bmp files.  It
    expects to see such a file on the standard input.  Try:

    ./prog <pic.bmp

    The pictures are converted so that each pixel makes an ascii character.
    So use small pictures if you want the results to fit in your terminal
    window.

    Of course the source itself is also an ascii art picture!  Notice the
    lines are 108 chars long, so be sure to view it in a wide window.

    The actual program is well hidden in amoungst the artwork - a run
    through cpp helps, but there's plenty left...
