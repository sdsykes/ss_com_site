<br><h2>Entries in the 2004 IOCCC</h2>

          <p>My first entry (authored together with "Mtv Europe") was a chess playing program.  You can look at the <a href="assets/IOCCC/doodoo.remarks.txt">remarks</a>, and you can <a href="assets/IOCCC/doodoo.c">download the program</a>.  I am particularly pleased with this entry - the formatting is really cool, and it plays chess absolutely hopelessly. (This entry did not win in the IOCCC.)</p>

<p>My second entry was a utility to hide files steganographically in other files.  You can look at the <a href="assets/IOCCC/steg.remarks.txt">remarks</a>, and you can <a href="assets/IOCCC/steg.c">download the program</a>.  It was quite neat to hide the steganographic encoder program inside the decoder program - which is the program provided.  You just need to run program on its own source, and you get the encoder program.</p>
